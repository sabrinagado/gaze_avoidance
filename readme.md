Script "main.R" sources all relevant other scripts to perform analyses and create plots included in the manuscript and the Supplementary Materials

For the analysis-scripts to work save the data from the OSF repository at the following location:
- Data - Study 1/Discrimination Task --> gca_avoidance/Study 1/Experiment/gaze_discrimination_task/data
- Data - Study 1/Experimental Task --> gca_avoidance/Study 1/Experiment/gaze_avoidance_task/data

- Data - Study 2/Discrimination Task --> gca_avoidance/Study 2/Experiment/gaze_discrimination_task2/data
- Data - Study 2/Experimental Task --> gca_avoidance/Study 2/Experiment/attentional_competition_task/data

For the experimental scripts to work you need a folder "stimuli" and "audio" in the folders "gaze_avoidance_task" and "attentional_competition_task" as well as a folder "stimuli" in the folders "gaze_discrimination_task" and "gaze_discrimination_task2".
If you want to use the original stimuli and audio files, please get in contact with the authors: sabrina.gado@uni-wuerzburg.de
